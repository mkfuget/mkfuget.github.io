For my rails project I started by thinking about kinds of projects I could do that would be impressive visually. I think especially for the purpose of porfolio work but also in real software development it is important to have visually appealing products as it conveys a sense of quality in your products and improves the user experience. I came up with an application for advertising and booking hotel rentals, which after some iteration became a generalized app for posting properties and for users to book rental properties. The functionality is pretty similar to AirBnb but included some helpful features to filter your searches when looking for propertise to fit your needs, and a nice layout for advertising your property. 

My main takeaway from this experience is the benefits to properly structuring your work flow in a project. I found that I would contiually add features I wanted to implement and that often required redoing early portions of my project to accomodate. While it is a useful skill to be able to update your previous work to new requirements, I feel like taking a bit more time to think up the features I wanted to have available from the start could have streamlined the development process for me. In addition, it is important to set reasonable limits for any project on the scope you want the application to cover. It is easy to come up with an additional use case that a customer would want to see but it is important to remember that additional features come with costs to project timelines and add additional complexity to your application.
